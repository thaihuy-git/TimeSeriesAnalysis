## Time Series Analysis (Using SQL)
This project extends the RFM analysis by using advanced SQL skills to obtain more detailed, time-based insights about customer behaviour and sales performance. Using the same transactional dataset from the grocery shop, the analysis seeks to identify temporal sales trends, customer purchasing patterns, seasonal peaks, and product performance.

### Project takeaway
Apply advanced SQL skills such as JOINs, CTEs, subqueries, temporary tables, Windows Functions

### Project goal
The goal of this project is to expand on the previous RFM Analysis by using SQL-driven time series and product-level insights to better understand sales performance across customers, products, time periods, and locations. The project is used to support strategic marketing, customer retention, and inventory optimization efforts.

### Project scope
This project focuses on performing a time-based analysis of grocery store sales data using SQL in order to identify relevant business insights beyond the previous RFM segmentation. The research is limited to the current transactional sales dataset and focuses on temporal sales patterns, consumer purchasing behaviour over time, and product/sales performance.
